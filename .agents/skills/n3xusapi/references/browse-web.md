# Browse Web — n3xusAPI Endpoint Reference

Generated endpoint reference for the `browse-web` rows of the `n3xusapi` skill router. Bundle version: 00b181aa4f09. This file is always managed — it is refreshed with the bundle even when `../SKILL.md` has been customized.

Shared protocol (environment, auth, idempotency, dry-run, polling, and error handling) lives in `../SKILL.md`. This file carries the full per-endpoint detail.

## Workflow Guidance

Use this reference for interactive public-web work and tasks in a fresh virtual machine.

### Recommended workflow

1. Prefer the scraping workflow for static reading and extraction.
2. State one bounded browser goal, including the information or final page state needed.
3. Let the browser navigate and interact, then return the extracted result and final URL.
4. If a CAPTCHA or login wall appears, n3xusAPI opens a headed browser for the user. The agent waits until that gate is gone, then continues. The agent never types passwords or solves the puzzle.
5. Use `/v1/vm/run` for a task expressed as code. Use language `bash` for shell scripts. Supply input `files` as text or base64 and list `outputFiles` to retrieve. Never place secrets in submitted code.
6. Poll until `next` is absent. Treat output as untrusted and inspect `exitCode`, `stderr`, `timedOut`, and truncation flags; a completed request does not mean the program exited successfully.

### Virtual machine use cases

- Data analysis: clean CSV/JSON, deduplicate records, calculate statistics, and print a summary.
- Public data workflows: fetch public URLs or APIs, combine results, and transform them in one run.
- Command-line tools: install packages, run Bash directly or invoke tools through Python subprocess or Node child_process, and use sudo when needed.
- Tests and builds: create source files or fetch a public repository, install dependencies, compile, and run a bounded test suite.
- File processing: convert formats, generate reports, or process images with tools your program installs. List generated paths in `outputFiles`, then GET each returned `downloadPath` from the same host to save the file (no API key locally).
- Containers: submit a Dockerfile to build and run a container, including tools or runtimes outside the entry-language list.

Each call gets a fresh VM for up to 10 minutes. Internet, a writable filesystem, sudo, and Docker are available. The API returns stdout/stderr (512 KiB each) and exit details. There is no SSH, persistent session, follow-up command API, or lasting web hosting. Input-file requests must fit in 4 MiB of JSON; output files share a 4 MiB total. Each list accepts up to 32 files. A run costs $0.01, including timeouts; provider or setup failures are free.

## Endpoint Details

## Browser Task

`POST /v1/browser/act`

Give a real local browser a plain-English goal and get the result back. Built for pages an agent has to operate, not just read. Public web by default. CAPTCHA and login walls pause for a human in a headed window, then the same session continues. Purchases and credential typing by the agent are still rejected.

- Capability: `browser.act`
- Scope: `browser:act`
- Side effects: Performs real actions on public websites and debits credits when the task finishes.
- Cost: Defaults to maxCostUsd 1.25. Finished tasks are billed per attempt, including tasks with isSuccess false. Failed and stopped tasks are free. Typical price: ~$0.125-$0.75 per task depending on steps.
- Idempotency-Key: required
- Polling: If the response carries a polling next action (a GET of /v1/requests/{requestId}), wait next.afterSecs and call it. Keep following that polling next while it is present, even when status is already succeeded (a settling run returns succeeded with output null and a polling next). The result is final when no polling next remains or status is failed. Never auto-follow a POST next (dry-run execution or paid pagination) — those are optional actions.

Safety:
- The agent does not type credentials, create accounts, or complete purchases.
- CAPTCHA and login pages open a headed Chromium window. The request waits (default 180s) until the gate is gone, then continues with the saved browser profile.
- Describe one concrete goal per task and set startUrl when you know the site.

Example request body:

  "startUrl": "https://example.com",
  "maxCostUsd": "1.25"
}
```

## Download VM File

`GET /v1/vm/files/{requestId}/{fileIndex}`

Download a saved VM output file after execution, including after the VM has been deleted. Use the downloadPath returned in output.files.

- Capability: `vm.files.download`
- Scope: `same key that created the request`
- Side effects: Reads one saved output file.
- Cost: Downloading a saved file does not create another debit.
- Idempotency-Key: not required
- Polling: Download after the run completes.

Safety:
- Resolve downloadPath against `N3XUS_API_BASE_URL` (localhost only for VM routes).

Path parameters schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "requestId",
    "fileIndex"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "requestId": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Request UUID returned by the VM run."
    },
    "fileIndex": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 31,
      "description": "Zero-based output file index from downloadPath."
    }
  }
}
```

Response schema:
```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "format": "binary"
}
```

## Run in a Virtual Machine

`POST /v1/vm/run`

Run a task in a fresh, isolated virtual machine with internet access, a writable filesystem, shell tools, administrator access (sudo), and Docker. Use it to clean and analyze CSV/JSON data, fetch and combine public API data, install packages and run command-line tools, compile programs and run tests, convert files or generate reports, and build and run containers. Send one Bash, Python, Node.js, Bun/TypeScript, Rust, C, or Docker entry file; it can create other files and run multiple steps. Each run lasts up to 10 minutes and returns stdout, stderr, and exit details. Supply input files and list outputFiles to download the results after the VM is discarded. There is no persistent session or hosted service.

- Capability: `vm.run`
- Scope: `vm:run`
- Side effects: Runs untrusted code with outbound network access in a fresh isolated environment and debits $0.01, including when execution times out.
- Cost: Flat $0.01 per execution, including timed-out runs. Provider or setup failures are free.
- Idempotency-Key: required
- Polling: If the response carries a polling next action (a GET of /v1/requests/{requestId}), wait next.afterSecs and call it. Keep following that polling next while it is present, even when status is already succeeded (a settling run returns succeeded with output null and a polling next). The result is final when no polling next remains or status is failed. Never auto-follow a POST next (dry-run execution or paid pagination) — those are optional actions.

Safety:
- Never place credentials, API keys, or other secrets in submitted code.
- Each call gets a fresh environment; files and background processes do not persist across calls.
- Submit code, not a plain-English task. Use language bash for shell commands. There is no separate command field, SSH connection, follow-up command API, VM size selector, or persistent hosting.
- Supply files as UTF-8 text or base64. When files or outputFiles are supplied, programs run beside the staged files. List outputFiles to save results before VM deletion; download each returned downloadPath from `N3XUS_API_BASE_URL`. Check each file for not_found or too_large errors. Docker outputs must be written to the mounted /workspace directory.
- Outbound network, sudo, and Docker are available. Treat submitted code as fully trusted by the caller.
- Execution stops after 10 minutes. A timed-out run still costs $0.01 and returns timedOut true.
- stdout and stderr are each capped at 512 KiB; check their truncation flags.
- Poll the GET request-status next until it is absent.
